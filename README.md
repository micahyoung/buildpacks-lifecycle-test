## Commands

### Build

Either:
* `detector` - Chooses buildpacks (via `/bin/detect`) and produces a build plan.
* `analyzer` - Restores layer metadata from the previous image and from the cache.
* `restorer` - Restores cached layers.
* `builder` -  Executes buildpacks (via `/bin/build`).
* `exporter` - Creates an image and caches layers.

Or:
* `creator` - Runs the five phases listed above in order.

### Run

* `launcher` - Invokes a chosen process.

### Rebase

* `rebaser` - Creates an image from a previous image with updated base layers.

## Development
To test, build, and package binaries into an archive, simply run:

```bash
$ make all
```
This will create an archive at `out/lifecycle-<LIFECYCLE_VERSION>+linux.x86-64.tgz`.

`LIFECYCLE_VERSION` defaults to the value returned by `git describe --tags` if not on a release branch (for more information about the release process, see [RELEASE](RELEASE.md). It can be changed by prepending `LIFECYCLE_VERSION=<some version>` to the
`make` command. For example:

```bash
$ LIFECYCLE_VERSION=1.2.3 make all
```

Steps can also be run individually as shown below.

### Test

Formats, vets, and tests the code.

```bash
$ make test
```

### Build

Builds binaries to `out/linux/lifecycle/`.

```bash
$ make build
```

> To clean the `out/` directory, run `make clean`.

### Package

Creates an archive at `out/lifecycle-<LIFECYCLE_VERSION>+linux.x86-64.tgz`, using the contents of the
`out/linux/lifecycle/` directory, for the given (or default) `LIFECYCLE_VERSION`.

```bash
$ make package
```
